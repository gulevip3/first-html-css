            <h3>Erly life and education</h3>
            <p class="p">Mihajlo Pupin was an ethnic Serb, born on 4 October in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day
                municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in the region of Banat, in the Military Frontier of the Austrian
                Empire, 1858.Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to
                German elementary school in Perlez. He enrolled in high school in Pančevo, and later in the Real
                Gymnasium. He was one of the best students there; a local archpriest saw his enormous potential and
                talent, and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.

            <h3>Literary Work</h3>
            <p class="p">Mihajlo Pupin, renowned scientist and inventor, published his autobiography "From Immigrant to
                Inventor"
                in 1923, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1924. The book chronicles his journey from humble
                beginnings in Serbia to a successful life in America. It includes numerous scientific papers, articles,
                and personal reflections. In 1929, it was released in Serbian under the title "Od pašnjaka do
                naučenjaka. There are a large number of works written by Mihajlo Pupin. You will find them on the

            <h3>Pupin coils</h3>
            <p class="p">Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on
                the pioneering work of the English polymath Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some
                seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by
                American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they
                made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had
                up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose
                control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of
                long-distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
